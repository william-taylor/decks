                    <b>Author:</b> Per Beining an Agile consultant, joined a financial services 
                    firm as a Scrum Master for two teams and transitioned into a Project Manager.

                <p>
                    <b>Goal:</b> Move a system from private to public cloud. Reimplementing features and 
                    configuraiton so it could be run on a a public cloud platform.

                    <b>Progress:</b> The project had been running for more than a year, 
                    and the product owner and wider team showed high 
                    levels of competence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Problem:</b> Nothing had been released to users and they were 6 weeks 
                    away from their first deadline. As such they looked to alternative methods 
                    to get back on track.

                    Moved to the FAST Agile Framework after getting approval
                    from the Product Owner giving the wider group a 1 hour 
                    introduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organising into a single collective with an agreement in place, 
                    moved to short 2 day value cycles, trusted people to own their 
                    work.

                <p>
                    They met their deadline and the system was launched with real users. The short 
                    value cycles enabled the project to pivot where needed and meet the operational
                    needs of the system while also working on new features.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their success saw a move in the wider organisation. They took a poll
                    to see if people wanted to go back to scrum, 9 were in favour
                    of FAST and none against.
